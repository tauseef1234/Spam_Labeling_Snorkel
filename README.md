# Snorkel - Data labeling using weak supervision

In this project, we will walk through the process of using Snorkel to build a training set for classifying text messages as spam or not spam. Additional goal of this project is to demonstrate the basic components and concepts of Snorkel, but also to dive into the actual process of iteratively developing real applications using Snorkel.
